1. Light Sensing System

	Brightness of LED is adjusted by photosensor. Photosensor value is read by Analog-to-Digital Converter. If the photosensor value is low (if the brightness of the room is low) then the brightness of the LED is low, and vice versa.

2: Tone Generation System

	Piezoelectronic buzzer frequency is adjusted by potentiometer angle. Angle of potentiometer is read by Analog-to-Digital Converter.
	Minimum frequency is 1046Hz and maximum is 2093Hz.
